  <h1>The Environment Record Type Hierarchy</h1>

  <p>The Environment Record abstract class includes the abstract specification methods defined in <emu-xref href="#table-abstract-methods-of-environment-records"></emu-xref>. These abstract methods have distinct concrete algorithms for each of the concrete subclasses.</p>

          Determine if an Environment Record has a binding for the String value _N_. Return *true* if it does and *false* if it does not.

      <tr>
        <td>
          CreateMutableBinding(N, D)
        </td>
        <td>
          Create a new but uninitialized mutable binding in an Environment Record. The String value _N_ is the text of the bound name. If the Boolean argument _D_ is *true* the binding may be subsequently deleted.

          CreateImmutableBinding(N, S)

        <td>
          Create a new but uninitialized immutable binding in an Environment Record. The String value _N_ is the text of the bound name. If _S_ is *true* then attempts to set it after it has been initialized will always throw an exception, regardless of the strict mode setting of operations that reference that binding.

        <td>
          Set the value of an already existing but uninitialized binding in an Environment Record. The String value _N_ is the text of the bound name. _V_ is the value for the binding and is a value of any ECMAScript language type.

          SetMutableBinding(N, V, S)
        </td>
        <td>
          Set the value of an already existing mutable binding in an Environment Record. The String value _N_ is the text of the bound name. _V_ is the value for the binding and may be a value of any ECMAScript language type. _S_ is a Boolean flag. If _S_ is *true* and the binding cannot be set throw a *TypeError* exception.

      <tr>
        <td>
          GetBindingValue(N, S)
        </td>
        <td>
          Returns the value of an already existing binding from an Environment Record. The String value _N_ is the text of the bound name. _S_ is used to identify references originating in strict mode code or that otherwise require strict mode reference semantics. If _S_ is *true* and the binding does not exist throw a *ReferenceError* exception. If the binding exists but is uninitialized a *ReferenceError* is thrown, regardless of the value of _S_.

          DeleteBinding(N)
        </td>
        <td>
          Delete a binding from an Environment Record. The String value _N_ is the text of the bound name. If a binding for _N_ exists, remove the binding and return *true*. If the binding exists but cannot be removed return *false*. If the binding does not exist return *true*.
