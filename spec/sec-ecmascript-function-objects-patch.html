  <h1>ECMAScript Function Objects</h1>
  <p>ECMAScript function objects encapsulate parameterized ECMAScript code closed over a lexical environment and support the dynamic evaluation of that code. An ECMAScript function object is an ordinary object and has the same internal slots and the same internal methods as other ordinary objects. The code of an ECMAScript function object may be either strict mode code (<emu-xref href="#sec-strict-mode-code"></emu-xref>) or non-strict code. An ECMAScript function object whose code is strict mode code is called a <dfn id="strict-function">strict function</dfn>. One whose code is not strict mode code is called a <dfn id="non-strict-function">non-strict function</dfn>.</p>
  <p>In addition to [[Extensible]] and [[Prototype]], ECMAScript function objects also have the internal slots listed in <emu-xref href="#table-internal-slots-of-ecmascript-function-objects"></emu-xref>.</p>

          Defines how `this` references are interpreted within the formal parameters and code body of the function. ~lexical~ means that `this` refers to the *this* value of a lexically enclosing function. ~strict~ means that the *this* value is used exactly as provided by an invocation of the function. ~global~ means that a *this* value of *undefined* or *null* is interpreted as a reference to the global object, and any other *this* value is first passed to ToObject.
